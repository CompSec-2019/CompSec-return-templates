# Answer template for Lab 3: Botnes and malwares


Make a step-by-step report from what you did. (What, why and how?)
You can use screenshots, code snippets and anything, what Markdown enables you to use. Answer at least for the questions presented in each section.
They should be same than in actual instructions. 

You can add possible source files to [src](src) folder and screenshots to [img](img) folder.
You have to create these by yourself.

*You can remove questions and just leave task numbers/letters if you want.*

**Answer to this document, and push changes to Git!**

## Task 1: Finding traces of DDoS attack

### A) At what time (in which second) there were the most requests for server? How many requests there were in that moment?

 * How did you proceed?
 * Show all possible commands you used
 
  ```shell
  You can insert commands like this.
  ```

 * Explain the purposes of all commands in this task
 * Explain theory, what is the logic behind commands possible combination of them (=why did you choose them in the first hand?)

### B) How servers were actually loaded/burdened? There were multiple requests for server at same time of course, but some weakness of service/server was also exploited. What was the weakness and what did the queries do to exploit it?

* What was the functionality, which was used?
* What was the weakness/Why previous thing worked?

### C) At what time attack started? With help of section B. information, you are able to give valid guess. There were actually two episodes for attacks. We want to know earlier one.

* What was the time?
* Why did you choose this time?

### D) What IP address(es) hypotetically points towards controller of botnet itself?

* What IP addresses(es)?
* Why did you think that they might belong to attacker?

## Task 2: Malware - dynamic analysis

### B) Dynamic analysis



* Based on analysing network traffic and connections - shortly describe what malware is doing
  * Malware is connecting to some domain, which one?
  * What it did at first with domain?
  * After that, some kind of harmful cycle started. Can you describe it?
  * Describe which details in result files gave required information

* Compare start and end logs in memlogs folder

  * What are mutexes in programs, and why are we analysing them?
  * Which new processes were spawned?
  * If you compare mutexes, what are they telling about the program we launched?
  * What are differences in netscans telling?

* Based on disk analysis, can you guess what files malware created? What entries in registry it edited? Why it was useful for malware to edit these entries?

### C) Inspecting the server (Command & Control center)

* What exact information bot got from the server?
* You can give code here or additionally put it into *src* folder.
```python
You can insert your code here
```
* Provide screenshot, when it is receiving data. You can put it in *img* folder and reference here.

## Task 3: Malware - static analysis

### A) What's the role of SteamCodeGenerator.exe, keycrack.exe and steam-dll-pro.exe?

### B) How are they trying to hide their current/upcoming activites?

* For example, did they edit some settings in the operating system?

### C) What's the role of anti-cheat-bypass-tool.exe in Data folder?

* We are particularly interested about this file.
* This file contains actually two additional binaries. What are their names?
* **Find a way** to reverse these files as well, and include the general purposes of these files as well to your report. Additionally:
  * How bots were controlled? There were at least two ways, describe at least the automatic approach.
  * Some source code or ideas of some common DDoS tools have been used in this malware. Describe three of them. It's enough to identify tools, you can look information about them elsewhere.
  * Malware actually contains hidden GUI for DDoS tools it is using. Can you find and use it? Describe how you did it.

### D) How well you were able to gather information from malware with dynamic analysis when compared to full reveal from source code? (optional question, does not affect grade)


## Task 4:

**Implement **one** of the described tasks, and make step-by-step report (what, why and how) for what you did. Include possible source files to *src* folder.**
